# Getting Started with React

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of React and how to get started with your first React application.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components".

## Key Features

- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
- **JSX**: Syntax extension for JavaScript
- **Virtual DOM**: Efficient updates
- **One-way Data Flow**: Predictable state management

## Getting Started

To create a new React application, you can use Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Basic Concepts

### Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

### Props

Props are how components talk to each other:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Sara" />;
}
```

## Next Steps

Once you've mastered the basics, you might want to explore:

- React Hooks
- Context API
- React Router
- State Management

Happy coding!
