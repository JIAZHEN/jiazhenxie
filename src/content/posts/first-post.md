Woohoo, my blog is done.

I will start to post my ruby learning in here. In the meantime, will also share my experiences. I hope this can help all of us to learn and to be progressed.

This blog is supporting [github-flavored-markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). It's better than `WYSIWYG`.

It's late now in the UK, heading to the bed.

Fingers crossed I can get more and more people to share opinions and learn together.
