# Sprint Planning is Hard—Here's How AI is Changing the Game

Sprint planning is crucial—but let's face it, it's tough. **Really tough.** Especially when managing multiple teams with diverse specialties. As an Engineering Manager (EM), I find sprint planning consistently challenging because specialty capacities—how many complexity points each specialty can realistically handle—live mostly in my head. This mental overhead limits empowerment because it restricts sprint planning to experienced EMs rather than enabling engineers across the team.

Even though we've been diligently tracking complexity points, there's still significant reliance on my experience to interpret trends, recommend adjustments, and factor in external influences like public holidays. This manual process is not only exhausting but inherently error-prone and bottlenecks our agility.

## 🚀 Enter AI: A Revolutionary Shift in Sprint Planning

We're living in the era of AI—so why continue sprint planning like it's 2010? Recently, I've experimented with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance our sprint planning.

Here's the game changer: I simply feed the LLM data from the past two or three sprints, and it instantly provides insightful trend analyses and recommendations for complexity points tailored to upcoming sprints. This isn't just theoretical—it's practical, actionable innovation.

Using an LLM eliminates the guesswork and significantly reduces dependency on individual EM experience. The AI identifies trends we might overlook and automatically factors in adjustments for anomalies such as public holidays.

## ⚙️ How Does It Work?

I wrote a script to call the OpenAI API, carefully crafting prompts to extract meaningful insights. Prompt engineering is key here—choosing the right model and tailoring prompts significantly impacts accuracy. And guess what? It works! The script provides a recommended capacity range, derived from the complexity points historically completed by the teams. Here's an example of the recommendation:

## 🌟 Empowering the Team, Freeing the Managers

The benefits are immediate and tangible:

- **Democratization of Planning:** Engineers, not just managers, can now confidently run sprint planning sessions.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** AI-generated insights are based on data, reducing bias and human error.
- **Efficiency and Empowerment:** It frees up my mental space and empowers the entire engineering team to take ownership of planning.

## 🤖 Embracing AI for Agile Excellence

Leveraging AI in sprint planning isn't just innovative—it's essential. It aligns perfectly with agile principles, enabling us to be more responsive, accurate, and empowered.

It's time we fully embraced AI in engineering leadership. Sprint planning might always be challenging, but with AI, it no longer needs to be hard.
