As an engineering leader, I know how easy it is to lose touch with the hands-on work. You start out loving to code and build things, but the higher you rise, the fuller your calendar gets. Before you know it, days (or weeks) go by without writing a single line of code. This post is about why that happens, what has recently changed thanks to generative AI, and how we can rekindle our creative coding spark even with limited time.

## Why Engineering Leaders Stepped Back from Coding

Moving into leadership often means trading keyboard time for meeting time. It’s not that we want to stop coding; it’s that we genuinely can’t find the hours. In fact, many engineering managers and even directors continue coding as long as they can, until time constraints finally make it impossible. The demands of strategy, people management, and back-to-back meetings eventually push coding to the margins of our day. Hands-on exploration becomes a luxury we think we can’t afford.

Stepping away from coding can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, focusing on high-level strategy and team enablement is our job. On the other, giving up all hands-on work can distance us from the technical creativity that got us here. Seasoned tech execs warn that if you get too far from the details, “you just become a bureaucrat”. In other words, losing that maker’s touch means losing insight into the craft. Some even argue that managers who abandon coding risk losing touch with tech realities and struggle to mentor or estimate projects effectively. I’ve felt this myself – I’d have ideas buzzing in my head, but no time to tinker and try them out. Over time, that can dull the very curiosity and creativity that make us effective engineering leaders.

## What Generative AI Is Changing for Busy Leaders

Enter generative AI. In the last couple of years, AI tools have dramatically lowered the barrier to go from idea to prototype. They are enabling those of us with barely any coding time to build things again. Tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Cursor (an AI-powered code editor), and GitHub Copilot act like on-demand pair programmers who never get tired. With ChatGPT, for example, I can describe a feature in plain English and get workable code back in seconds – no more spending hours combing through Stack Overflow for answers when the AI can produce a solution almost instantly. It’s been genuinely described as having an extra team member who rapidly transforms ideas into code.

Meanwhile, tools like Cursor integrate these AI capabilities directly into your development workflow. Cursor has been called “ChatGPT that knows your codebase”, meaning it can answer questions about your own repository and even generate new code in context. And GitHub Copilot sits right in your IDE, auto-completing entire functions or suggesting snippets as you type. It’s not just a gimmick—early data shows Copilot can boost a developer’s productivity by ~20%. For someone who only has a sliver of time to code, that productivity gain is like gold. In short, generative AI is shifting the landscape so dramatically that what used to take days of effort can sometimes be achieved in under an hour of focused work.

## My 1-Hour Prototype – Text to Video with AI

Not long ago, I had this idea I couldn’t stop thinking about: what if I could turn a block of text into a short video, complete with AI-generated narration? It wasn’t just a thought experiment—I could already see how it might work. I had the mental blueprint laid out: the tools, the steps, the kind of output I wanted. But like a lot of engineering leaders, I didn’t have a full weekend to sink into building it from scratch.

Still, I decided to give it a go. I opened up a fresh project in Cursor—completely blank—and started outlining the structure in plain language. Four steps. That’s all I needed: input the text, generate the audio, combine it with visuals, and export the final video. I didn’t write any code by hand at first. I just described what I wanted at each stage and let Cursor generate the scaffolding.

Within minutes, I had a full working draft, complete with tests. I ran:

```
python text_to_video.py -p path/to/story.txt -o path/to/output.mp4
```

And just like that, I had a 15-second video with smooth narration and clean transitions. No deep dives into unfamiliar libraries. No painstaking trial and error. Just idea to execution—in one sitting.

That moment stuck with me. I’ve built enough things to know how long projects like this usually take. This one didn’t feel rushed or hacked together—it felt thoughtfully built, just… fast. Because the heavy lifting—setup, syntax, boilerplate—wasn’t mine to carry.

What’s exciting isn’t just the time saved. It’s what that time opens up. With AI tools like Cursor, I can stay in a creative flow, even when my calendar is full. I don’t have to choose between being a builder and being a manager. I get to be both. And that feels like a small kind of magic.

## A New Era of Hands-On Leadership

Generative AI has given engineering leaders a rare opportunity: the chance to be builders again without sacrificing our leadership responsibilities. By leveraging AI assistants, we can write and ship code in hours instead of days, learn on the fly, and lead by example.

For me, this has rekindled the joy of programming—that spark of seeing something I imagined come to life. It reminded me why I fell in love with software engineering in the first place. And it’s made me a better leader: more in tune with my team’s work, more technically confident, and more innovative in how I approach problems.

If you’re an engineering leader who’s been feeling distant from the craft, give generative AI a try. Start with a small project or script that interests you. Let the AI handle the boilerplate, while you apply your experience to shape the result. You might be surprised at how much you can accomplish with a few well-placed prompts and an eagerness to build.
