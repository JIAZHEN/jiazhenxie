I was chatting with a friend who's been in the engineering industry for many years as an Individual Contributor. When I expressed doubts about lacking tangible craftsmanship in management, he casually remarked, _"Management is an art."_ I was fascinated—management truly is an art form. It reminded me of a Chinese proverb: **将熊熊一窝** (_"The strength of the army depends on its commander."_), emphasising that the effectiveness of leadership profoundly shapes team performance. With many years in management, I decided to explore the artistry of management further.

In 2025, state-of-the-art software engineering management revolves around key themes such as Engineering Leadership and Team Health, Developer Productivity and Experience, and AI-Augmented Development and Management. In this post, I'll specifically discuss Engineering Leadership, focusing on psychological safety.

## Psychological Safety: The Foundation of High-Performance Teams

Psychological safety—the belief that one can speak openly without fear of negative consequences—is foundational for high-performing engineering teams. It is particularly critical in the rapidly evolving software engineering field, where innovation and risk-taking are essential.

Google’s influential [Project Aristotle study](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/understanding-team-effectiveness/steps/introduction/) identified psychological safety as the most significant factor driving team effectiveness. Safe teams are more creative, proactive, and willing to experiment—qualities essential for navigating complex engineering challenges.

I vividly recall a time when a direct report openly said, _"Jiazhen, we have a big problem in our production billing system,"_ or frankly remarked, _"The company process is stressful."_ Their comfort in candidly voicing concerns demonstrated a psychologically safe environment where issues could be proactively tackled. Such openness directly improved engineering outcomes, allowing early resolution of critical bugs and enabling innovative process improvements.

## How to Build Psychological Safety

Building psychological safety involves nuanced understanding, empathy, and deliberate cultivation. My guiding principle is straightforward: **"Treat people the way you want to be treated."** Key practices include:

- **Active Listening**: Creating space for open dialogue and listening without judgement helps team members feel respected.
- **Consistency and Trust**: Consistently demonstrating fairness and transparency builds reliable and predictable leadership.
- **Modelling Vulnerability**: Sharing personal mistakes encourages open discussion, fostering continuous improvement.

From a business perspective, psychological safety enhances product quality and market responsiveness by allowing quicker identification of customer pain points, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and driving innovation.

Erin Meyer's _The Culture Map_ highlights understanding diverse communication styles in multicultural teams. Applying these insights significantly improved my team's cohesion, reduced misunderstandings, and accelerated project delivery.

## A Personal Example

Early in my leadership journey, I noticed a team hesitant to take initiative due to fear of criticism. By intentionally promoting psychological safety—openly sharing personal learnings, actively seeking feedback, and acknowledging team contributions—I witnessed a transformative shift. Team members began proactively suggesting improvements, volunteering for complex tasks, and confidently taking ownership. This positively impacted engineering quality and improved product delivery timelines.

## Conclusion

Viewing management as an art, especially in software engineering, means placing psychological safety at the core. It involves balancing empathy with accountability and innovation with structure, cultivating an environment where individuals excel.

As I continue refining my leadership artistry, I encourage you to reflect on how psychological safety can elevate your team's performance and creativity.
